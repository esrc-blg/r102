# About this course {-}

***Course Content***

This course builds on introductory R and expands on essential concepts for R. We cover common problems in data manipulation to pre-process datasets and we will cover some visualization. $99.5\%$ of a data scientist's job is data pre-processing and visualization. The rest is analysis. Therefore, brushing up on programming skills in R makes the experience of working with R a lot more enjoyable.

***Course Objectives***

Participants will learn data manipulation skills such as merging data, re-shaping it, aggregating it and more. Course participants should be a lot more comfortable in working with R upon completing this course.


***Course Prerequisites***

Participants are expected to have used R and RStudio before.

***Agenda***

1. Data sub-setting, logical conditions, missing values, simple plots
2. Tidyverse introduction: Simple data manipulation, renaming, summarizing, aggregating
3. Merging data
4. Reshaping data
5. Regular expressions

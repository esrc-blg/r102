We cover common problems in data manipulation to pre-process datasets and we will cover some visualization. \\(99.5\\%\\) of a data scientist’s job is data pre-processing and visualization. The rest is analysis. Therefore, brushing up on programming skills in R makes the experience of working with R a lot more enjoyable. Course Objectives Participants will learn data manipulation skills such as merging data, re-shaping it, aggregating it and more. Course participants should be a lot more comfortable in working with R upon completing this course. Course Prerequisites Participants are expected to have used R and RStudio before. Agenda Data sub-setting and logical conditions Tidyverse introduction: Simple data manipulation, renaming, summarizing, aggregating Merging data Reshaping data Regular expressions Acknowledgements The infrastructure for this website is in large parts adopted from work by UCL’s Altaf Ali, Jack Blumenau, Lucas Leemann, Slava Jankin Mikhaylov, and Philipp Broniecki.

By pre-processing, we mean storing data in such a way that observations are in rows and variables are in columns. Data comes in different forms and is not always stored in this way. We will use data from the World Bank to illustrate this point. Before getting started, we first need to install the tidyverse package like so: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You only need to install once. However, doing this again is not a mistake. In fact, R, RStudio and R packages are regularly updated. It is good practice to update all of these on your computer as well. Just remember never to update before a deadline! # clear workspace rm(list = ls()) # load tidyverse package library(tidyverse) -- Attaching packages ------------- v ggplot2 3.2.1 v purrr 0.3.2 v tibble 2.1.3 v dplyr 0.8.3 v tidyr 1.0.0 v stringr 1.4.0 v readr 1.3.1 v forcats 0.4.0 -- Conflicts ---------------------- x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() Let’s check whether we have updates available by runinng tidyverse_update() # check for available updates tidyverse_update() The following packages are out of date: * httr (1.4.0 -&gt; 1.4.1) * modelr (0.1.4 -&gt; 0.1.5) * tidyr (0.8.3 -&gt; 1.0.0) * xml2 (1.2.0 -&gt; 1.2.2) Start a clean R session then run: install.packages(c(&quot;httr&quot;, &quot;modelr&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;xml2&quot;)) R tells us that several packages are in indeed out of data (this may be different on your computer - it’s possible that everything is up to date on your machine). Below, we update according to the console message. install.packages(c(&quot;httr&quot;, &quot;modelr&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;xml2&quot;)) tidyverse_update() All tidyverse packages up-to-date Now, everything is updated correctly. Let’s check the codebook of our data.

["index.html", "Follow-up on R About this course", " Follow-up on R About this course Course Content This course builds on introductory R and expands on essential concepts for R. We cover common problems in data manipulation to pre-process datasets and we will cover some visualization. \\(99.5\\%\\) of a data scientist’s job is data pre-processing and visualization. The rest is analysis. Therefore, brushing up on programming skills in R makes the experience of working with R a lot more enjoyable. Course Objectives Participants will learn data manipulation skills such as merging data, re-shaping it, aggregating it and more. Course participants should be a lot more comfortable in working with R upon completing this course. Course Prerequisites Participants are expected to have used R and RStudio before.
